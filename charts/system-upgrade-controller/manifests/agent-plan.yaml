# SUC Agent Upgrade Plan — worker nodes
#
# DECISION: Agent plan runs AFTER server plan completes.
# Why: Workers must not run a newer kubelet than the API server.
#      Concurrency=2 speeds up worker upgrades (workers are stateless
#      from a cluster perspective; PDB protects workload availability).
