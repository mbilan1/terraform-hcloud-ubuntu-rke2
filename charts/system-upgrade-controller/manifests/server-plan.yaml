# SUC Server Upgrade Plan — control-plane nodes
#
# DECISION: Separate server and agent plans with sequential upgrades.
# Why: Control-plane must upgrade before workers (API compatibility).
#      Concurrency=1 ensures one node upgrades at a time (etcd quorum safety).
#
# NOTE: Replace KUBERNETES_VERSION with target version (e.g., "v1.34.3+rke2r1")
# or use channel-based upgrades (recommended for automatic patching).
