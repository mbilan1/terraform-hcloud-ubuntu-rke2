# cert-manager Helm values

# DECISION: Install CRDs via Helm chart (not separate kubectl apply).
# Why: Single lifecycle — chart upgrade updates CRDs automatically.
#      crds.keep=true ensures CRDs survive helm uninstall.

crds:
  enabled: true
  keep: true

  timeout: "5m"

# NOTE: Resource requests/limits follow container best practices (gate #145).
