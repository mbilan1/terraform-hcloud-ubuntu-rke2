# ClusterIssuer for Let's Encrypt (DNS-01 via Route53)
#
# DECISION: DNS-01 solver enables wildcard certificates (*.domain.com).
# Why: HTTP-01 only supports single-domain certs. DNS-01 is required for
#      wildcard coverage used by Harmony/Open edX subdomains.
#
# NOTE: Replace placeholder values before applying:
#   - ACME_EMAIL: Let's Encrypt registration email
#   - AWS_REGION: Route53 region (e.g., eu-central-1)
#   - HOSTED_ZONE_ID: Route53 hosted zone ID
#   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: IAM access key with Route53 permissions
#
# For HTTP-01 solver (no AWS credentials needed), see clusterissuer-http01.yaml
