# Kured Helm values — Kubernetes Reboot Daemon
# Chart: kubereboot/kured
# Ref: https://kured.dev/docs/
#
# DECISION: Kured for automated OS reboot scheduling after `apt upgrade`.
# Why: Ubuntu unattended-upgrades can install kernel patches, but a reboot
#      is needed to activate them. Kured coordinates node-by-node reboot
#      with cordon/drain to maintain workload availability.
#
# NOTE: Only effective on HA clusters (>=3 masters).
# On single-master clusters, rebooting the master loses etcd quorum.

configuration:
  period: "1h0m0s"

# NOTE: Resource requests/limits follow container best practices (gate #145).
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "10m"
    memory: "32Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "64Mi"
